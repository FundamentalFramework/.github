# _**Why was Fundamental Framework born?**_

The LUNA/UST case shook the entire market, it was an earthquake that destroyed the wallets and lives of many people, an event not seen since 2014 until Mt.Gox imploded. Personally I was not in Mt.Gox in 2014, just as luckily I was not in LUNA/UST. I admit… I had a meager 1200 UST stake on the Venus protocol but it's nothing, my heart didn't even beat for it.
My heart beats reading people who have lost a lot of money, some had very high exposure, contrary to any rational allocation (~5% of a risky and much discussed project like that of LUNA/UST). There may have been cases of investors starting with decent initial allocations of 3-5% to see a portfolio imbalance of more than 20-30% after the resounding performance. In this case, the mistake was not re-balancing the portfolio in view of a (positive) imbalance on the part of a project considered risky and unsustainable by many people.

I want to remind you that before the default, LUNA hit its all-time high about 30 days earlier, this fact brings to light the psychological disaster that many people are experiencing, from extremely rich or with high income rates, to zero. Not everyone is on social media to have their say or to complain, some people suffer in silence, because there really is little they can do, it is part of a person's character.

This prompted me to review my risk and allocation strategy, for me, and for all of you, it is a lesson to learn so as to implement a better investment strategy and risk calculation... Yes, risk... Why the risk curve also increases by having WETH or BTCB on BSC, these are by-products of native currencies, therefore they involve systemic risks that almost no one rationally calculates or deepens, now we take everything for granted without paying much attention to details.

Fundamental Framework aims to create sound, transparent and rational guidelines, without falling in love with protocols, coins or founders. You have to have the right detachment, be cold enough to avoid the so much rampant confirmation bias in which people with such strong convictions only seek confirmation of their ideas and then turn into faith and, in my opinion, this is the last resort of an investor.

The framework for the evaluation of new projects divided into macro areas will be selected as follows:

**[1.Phase one, initial study:](https://github.com/FundamentalFramework/Framework/blob/main/1.NewProjectStudyPhase.adoc)** The first phase is quite fast, here low-level projects are discarded, those in which we consider scams, meme projects, or projects whose developers' aim is to get rich quickly by making the unsuspecting participants believe they can get rich quickly;


**2. Second phase, qualitative elements:** After the first cut given by phase (1), the projects are analyzed in more detail such as; composition of the team, company, Whitepaper, tokenomics etc… this phase foresees a further cut to the projects that we consider not promising;



**3. Third phase, quantitative elements:** It involves the analysis in the quantitative profile. In this phase it is necessary to understand how active the network is based on the on-chain data, evaluate the potential for adoption, if the token price is inflated etc...


**4. Fourth phase, planning and purchase:** This phase involves the calculation of the risk of each investment, the allocated capital and the definition of the accumulation times.

These 4 macro phases will be broken down so as to dive into more detail on the actions to be taken to make the search and selection more accurate, sensible and professional.


# _**Is Fundamental Framework free?**_

Of course yes. There will be no attached service, it will be an Open Source project where ideas and methodologies will be developed that are useful for making fundamental analysis a central activity on investment choices.

Being an Open Source project, I hope that in the future collaborators will be added to bring their knowledge and make it available to the world. We increasingly need a comprehensive picture of how to approach the evaluation of new projects. The ecosystem evolves at the speed of light, we can't keep up with that evolution, it goes too fast and escapes our understanding.
We as human beings need time to internalize concepts and make them our own, but by ourselves it is impossible to do so, which is why I believe an open library is one of the best solutions to condense innovation and the genius of human beings.


Who I am: I am a 36 year old boy, I live in Italy and I have been in the Cryptocurrency market since late 2013. I bought my first BTC at the peak of $ 1000 and I lost everything on January 14th 2015 after that, discovering the leverage (at the time I was trading on okcoin futures), I burned all the capital, I was devastated.
I have fallen many times, I was impulsive before. I didn't have an economic or financial background, my qualification is eighth grade. But over time I learned a lot, studied and took risks.
The important thing is that when you fall you pick up something.
